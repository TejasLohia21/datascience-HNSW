## Background on HNSW

Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW) is a multi‑layer proximity graph where each point participates in several layers of decreasing density, enabling logarithmic‑time ANN search by combining long‑range “skip‑list” jumps with dense local links citeturn0search0turn0search1.  
During index construction, each new element is assigned a random maximum layer (exponential distribution) and is greedily linked to its closest neighbors at each layer, yielding state‑of‑the‑art recall‑speed trade‑offs citeturn1search0.  
Implementations such as **hnswlib** provide highly optimized C++/Python bindings, making HNSW the go‑to graph index in many vector databases citeturn0search6.

## Problem Formulation

**Goal:** Given a database of vectors $V$, and a set of example queries $Q$ with their true $k$-nearest neighbors, learn an adjacency function $f(i,j)\in\{0,1\}$ so that the resulting proximity graph supports efficient beam‑search retrieval, just like HNSW citeturn2search7.  
Unlike classic HNSW (which uses heuristic link insertion based purely on distance thresholds), our learned graph can adapt connectivity to the observed query distribution, potentially improving recall or reducing graph size for a target latency citeturn2search1.  

## Approaches to Learning Graph Structure

### 1. Supervised Edge Classification with GNNs  
**Idea:** Treat each candidate edge $(i,j)$ as a binary classification problem—positive if $j$ appears in at least one query’s true $k$-NN, negative otherwise—and train a Graph Neural Network to predict edge existence citeturn2search3.  
- **Data:** Build an initial $m$-NN graph (e.g. $m=20$) to define candidate edges.  
- **Model:** Use GraphSAGE or GCN layers to embed nodes, then an MLP on concatenated embeddings $[h_i \,\|\, h_j]$ to predict $p_{ij}$.  
- **Loss:** Binary cross‑entropy against ground‑truth edge labels derived from query outputs.  
At inference, threshold $p_{ij}$ to obtain a sparse adjacency suited for HNSW layering.

### 2. End‑to‑End Metric Learning for k‑NN  
**Idea:** Learn a transformation $f_\theta: \mathbb{R}^d\!\to\!\mathbb{R}^d$ so that standard Euclidean k‑NN on $\{f_\theta(x)\}$ recovers true neighbors, as in learned‑index methods for ANN citeturn2search9.  
- **Network:** A small MLP that maps raw vectors to a new space.  
- **Objective:** Hinge or contrastive ranking loss pushing positive pairs $(q,x^+)$ closer than negatives $(q,x^-)$:  
  $$
    \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{N}\sum \max\bigl(0,\, d(q^+,x^+)-d(q^+,x^-)+\delta\bigl).
  $$  
- **Graph Construction:** After training, build an HNSW index (via **hnswlib**) on the learned embeddings $f_\theta(V)$.  

### 3. Differentiable Soft Adjacency via Ranking Loss  
**Idea:** Parameterize a **soft** adjacency matrix $P$ where  
$$
  P_{ij} = \frac{\exp(-\|x_i - x_j\|^2/\tau)}{\sum_{k}\exp(-\|x_i - x_k\|^2/\tau)},
$$  
and learn $\tau$ (or a full Mahalanobis metric) so that true neighbors rank highest in each row, using InfoNCE or hinge‑ranking losses citeturn2search9.  
- **Optimization:** Backpropagate through the softmax to adjust $\tau$ or metric parameters.  
- **Thresholding:** Convert the continuous $P$ into discrete edges by selecting top‑$M$ entries per node, then assign layers randomly as in HNSW.

## Integrating a Learned Graph into HNSW

1. **Layer Assignment:** Adopt the original HNSW rule: sample a maximum layer for each node from an exponential distribution citeturn1search0.  
2. **Edge Pruning per Layer:** For each node and layer $\ell$, retain only the learned edges whose endpoints’ sampled layers $\ge\ell$.  
3. **Graph Serialization:** Use **hnswlib**’s low‑level API to load custom neighbor lists at each layer for fast query evaluation.  

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Recall@k:** Fraction of ground‑truth neighbors recovered within top $k$ visits.  
- **Query Latency / Distance Computations:** Average time or L2 calls per query beam‑search.  
- **Index Size:** Total number of edges across all layers.  
Compare against default HNSW (e.g. $M=16,\; \texttt{efConstruction}=200$) on benchmarks like SIFT1M or GloVe‑based datasets.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

Learning HNSW graph edges from query supervision is not only feasible but offers a path to **data‑driven index optimization** that can outperform standard heuristics on specialized workloads. Future work includes:

- **Joint Layer‑Edge Learning:** Simultaneously optimizing edge existence and layer assignments.  
- **Scalable Training:** Extending GNN or metric‑learning methods to hundreds of millions of points via sampling or cluster‑based mini‑batches.  
- **Dynamic Updates:** Online adaptation of the learned graph structure as new queries arrive, bridging the gap between static learned indices and real‑time streaming needs.
